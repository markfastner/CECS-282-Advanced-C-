/*
Create a class named Student with private data members â€“ name (string), score (int), and  grade (char). The class Student should have the following constructors, and function:

Student ();//Empty constructor
Student (string name, int score);
void print();//Display name (left  alignment ), score (right alignment ), and grade (right alignment). 

To determine the grade, use the following grade scale:

A  100-90
B  89-80
C  79-70
D  69-60
D  59-0

In the parameter constructor, you write code to assign a grade,

Write the main function to create an array of Student objects. Initialize the following Student objects using parameter constructor:

Tom    85
Alice   71
Jack    93
Mary   65
Sue    54

The program then print students' name, score, and grade.


Tom         85     B 
Alice        71     C
Jack        93     A
Mary       65     D
Sue        40     F
